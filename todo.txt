Things To Do
-----------------------------------
- Find a way to keep track of skill experience
- Find a way to keep track of skill levels
X Begin to set up layout of code
X Find a way to limit actions 
- Randomize forage amount based on level, versus always 5
- Figure out how to handle the story of the game
    - Maybe build out a story pane, similar to the log pane, that will have the story concepts within.
X Figure out how to manage hiding and showing new content based on where the player is
- Begin to rip out logic into classes and start unit testing a bit
- Make foraging cost energy, but gain energy slowly over time as you "rest"


Gameplay Loop
-----------------------------------
- Start off with foraging
- Click forage to gather a random amount of food, between 5-10 at level 1
- Every forage successful forage will give foraging experience
- Every foraging level will allow for foraging more food per level
- Eventually can utilize food to entice farmers to automate food production
- Eventually, can begin to mine minerals (maybe start with copper, iron, etc by level)
- Mining, and any other task other than foraging, costs food. This will be managed via a hunger stat which can change based on various things.
- With minerals, can create tools that you can sell, or use to automate mining and foraging more effectively
- Somehow, unlock other skills that you can use to create more capital, or can use to automate things more effectively
- As you begin to unlock other skills, and grow to automate further, you build up a village that automates for you
